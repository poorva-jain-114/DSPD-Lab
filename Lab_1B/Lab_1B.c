/*AIM:    B.	Write a program to implement a Binary Search algorithm. Write a search function which takes a SearchList as its first parameter and a Comparable as its second. If either parameter is null, or if the SearchList is empty, you should return NULL.
 implement the following algorithm: 
        • Examine the value in the middle of the current array and print it. 
        • If the midpoint value is the value that we are looking for, return true 
        • If the value that we are looking for is greater than the midpoint value, adjust the current array to start at the midpoint and print the index.
        • if the value that we are looking for is less than the midpoint value, adjust the current array to end at the midpoint  and print the index.
        • Continue until you find the value, or until the start reaches the end,
