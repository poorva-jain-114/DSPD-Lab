<h2>
    Brief Introduction of this DSPD_Lab_Practicals Repository:-
</h2>
"DSPD_Lab_Practicals" Repository has been part of learning and teaching material for the most of the Engineering and Science Institutes around the country for years now.
<br>This Repo contains total 13 Lab Practical Problems of C language on different topics like array, structure, binary search, bubble sort, structure, queue, stack, linked lists, tree, graph, file handling, hash set which covers maximum part of any Programming Language.</br>
Go through all these programs to learn How to solve any program or How to approach towards the solution of given problem . I solved many problems in different different ways through which you can grasp that concept easily and quickly.</br>

## DSPD_Lab_Practicals:

1. [Lab_1A :	Write a program to accept ‘n’ numbers into an array and then calculate the sum of numbers present in odd positions and even positions respectively.	](https://github.com/poorva-jain-114/DSPD-Lab/blob/main/Lab_1A/Lab_1A.c)
2. [Lab_1B : Write a program to implement a Binary Search algorithm. Write a search function which takes a SearchList as its first parameter and a Comparable as its second. If either parameter is null, or if the SearchList is empty, you should return NULL.
 implement the following algorithm: 
• Examine the value in the middle of the current array and print it. 
• If the midpoint value is the value that we are looking for, return true 
• If the value that we are looking for is greater than the midpoint value, adjust the current array to start at the midpoint and print the index.
• if the value that we are looking for is less than the midpoint value, adjust the current array to end at the midpoint  and print the index.
• Continue until you find the value, or until the start reaches the end,
